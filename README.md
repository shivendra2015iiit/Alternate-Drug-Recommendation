# Alternate-Drug-Recommendation
In this project I was provided with list of drugs, there molecules and other infos. I was also provided with the list of service providers. I have to recommend alternate drug and its service providor names. 


## Some Catches :

There may be 2 drugs one in Injuction and other in tablet form, I have to recommend tablet first.
There may be same molecule but different ratings ( power of drug ), I have to recommend drug with same ratings first.
Name of the drug represent most of the information so I have to intuate from that.
Problem is not simple query based but based on pattern recognition.
I was provided with 2 hrs to complete this project. So the work shown in notebook is done within two hours.

To use code you can download notebook install jupyter or ipython notebook in your PC and install all the imported libraries using

pip install <name of library> 
  or
conda install <name of library>
